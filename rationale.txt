C0301, Line too long
Added to ensure code is more readable and because it will frustrate Zijad

C0303, Trailing whitespace
Added because I don't understand why anyone would put spaces at the end of a line. If you're done with a line, press enter and be done with it!

E0213, Method should have "self" as first argument

E0211, Method has no argument
I use classes so infrequently that I'd probably forget to put self in the arguments

C0102, Black listed name
