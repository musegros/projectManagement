# Git 'er done
I spent five seconds coming up with this title. On an unrelated note, if you 
want to see "Hello world" in your browser when you go to 127.0.0.1:5000, this is
the app for you.

## Installation
```make setup```

## Usage
1. ```make run```  
1. In any browser, navigate to ```127.0.0.1:5000```

## Make targets

Target | What it do
-------------|-----------
setup | Sets up python virtual environment and downloads all necessary packages
run | activates virtual environment and runs the app
clean | removes all files created by setup

## License

[WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/)

**Why WTFPL?**
1. I am not concerned at all with how this code gets used
1. I think the idea behind the license is kinda funny
